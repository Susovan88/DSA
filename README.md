# 📚 DSA Practice Repository (C++)

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** repository! 🚀  
This repository contains my **topic-wise implementations and practice problems in C++**, built to strengthen my **problem-solving skills** for:

- 💼 Coding Interviews  
- 🏆 Competitive Programming  
- 🧠 Core Computer Science Fundamentals  

> 🛠️ **Status:** Actively maintained & Ongoing — I regularly add new problems, improve solutions, optimize time/space complexity, and refactor code for clarity.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The main goals of this repository are to:

- ✅ Build a **strong foundation** in Data Structures & Algorithms  
- ✅ Practice **standard, interview-level, and advanced problems**  
- ✅ Learn and compare **multiple approaches**:
  - Brute Force
  - Optimized
  - Recursive / Iterative
  - Greedy / DP / Backtracking, etc.
- ✅ Improve:
  - Logical thinking  
  - Code quality  
  - Time & space optimization skills  
- ✅ Maintain a **clean, topic-wise revision guide** for quick interview prep

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap (How This Repo Is Organized)

Problems are grouped **by concept**, not by platform. Each folder focuses on **one core DSA topic** and contains:

- ✔️ Basic problems  
- ✔️ Intermediate problems  
- ✔️ Some advanced / tricky problems  
- ✔️ Sometimes multiple approaches for the same problem
